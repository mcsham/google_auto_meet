A solution for creating Google Meetings and automatically joining all users.
The idea is this: I often create Google Meetings and give “lectures”. Often, students join the meeting later. This is very distracting. In addition, I have to mark those who are late. So I had the idea to write a small script to help with this. 
The script creates meetings in Google and automatically joins all participants who want to join the conference.

## Coding is fun.
